The mixture was stirred and 50 % aqueous sodium hydroxide (1 mL) was added to give pH=12. The phases were separated and analyzed by means of HPLC- UV. The organic phase was concentrated under reduced pressure to give yellow oil. The crude product was purified by means of column chromatography (40 g SiO2; 4 % MeOH, 1 NH3 in MeOH in DCM; Rf=0.2).

LCMS of the crude reaction mixture shows the required product to be the major product together with an isomer of the same mass (Rt= 1.91), the ratio of the desired product to this isomeric product being circa 5:1. LCMS also shows that a small amount of the 2-aminooxazole ester starting material remains (Rt= 0.99 min) and so the reaction with this particular substrate may benefit from slightly longer reaction times, maybe 90 mins. A small amount of the coupled and decarboxylated product was also present (Rt= 1.68 min).  Saturated ammonium chloride (15 mL) was added to the crude reaction mixture and the mixture was transfrred to a separating funnel. Ethyl acetate (80 mL) was then added and the organic layer was separated (keeping the interfacial material with the organic layer). The aqueous layer was washed with ethyl acetate (2 x 80 mL portions). (Note: During this extraction, a solid, presumably the required product was seen to crash out in the organic layer. If this reaction is to be repeated a work-up free approach is recommended where the crude reaction mixture is dry-loaded directly onto silica for chromatographic purification). The solvent was removed from the combined organics under reduced pressure. The crude product was loaded onto a pre- wetted silica column using the minimum DCM and methanol.  The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 100% DCM (5% methanolic ammonia) in DCM. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford 744 mg of impure product.  The crude residue was triturated with Et2O to give a solid which was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum to give ethyl 2-(4-chloropyridin-2-ylamino)oxazole-5-carboxylate (415 mg, 44.3 %) as a beige solid.    Conclusion: The desired product was isolated in moderate yield and high purity (95% based on strength NMR). The moderate yield may be improved under a longer reaction time, it is also probable that purification difficulties were also detrimental to the yield of this reaction.

Taking into account that the crude LCMS for reaction (A) corresponds to a ~ 42% isolated yield, the amount of product can be calculated for reactions (B) and (C) using the ratio between the t-Butyl biphenyl and the required product in the LCMS.

An activated catalyst solution was prepared by adding TRIS(DIBENZYLIDENEACETONE)DIPALLADIUM(0) (61.3 mg, 0.07 mmol) and (9,9-dimethyl-9H-xanthene-4,5-diyl)bis(diphenylphosphine) (77 mg, 0.13 mmol) to an oven-dried microwave vial. The vial was then capped and purged with nitrogen and anisole (1 mL) (degassed) was added. The solution was stirred at 50°C for 40 mins, then 90°C for 15 mins (activated catalyst solution; Soln. 1).  To another oven-dried microwave vial was added potassium carbonate (126 mg, 0.91 mmol), oxazol-2-amine (102 mg, 1.22 mmol) and 2,4-dichloropyridine (90 mg, 0.61 mmol) and the vial was capped and purged with nitrogen. anisole (1.35 mL) and the activated catalyst solution (0.45 mL of Soln. 1 from above) were then added (this corresponds to a catalyst loading of 10% Pd). The vessel was then heated to 120 °C for 16 h. LCMS of the crude reaction mixture indicated that the desired product was present (Rt= 1.70) along with a trace amount of the double addition product i.e. amine addition at the 2- and 4-position (Rt= 1.22 min).  The reaction mixture was quenched with saturated ammonium chloride (8 mL) and transferred to a separating funnel. Ethyl acetate (15 mL) was then added and the organic layer was separated (keeping the interfacial material with the organic layer). The aqueous layer was washed with ethyl acetate (2 x 15 mL portions). The combined organics were then dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. DCM (1 mL) was then added to the resulting residue (which still contained anisole (4 mL)) and this solution was loaded directly onto a silica column (40 g).  The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 30% DCM (5% methanolic ammonia) in DCM, then 100% DCM (5% methanolic ammonia). Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford N-(4-chloropyridin-2-yl)oxazol-2-amine (59.0 mg, 49.6 %) as an off-white solid. Note: This product was only 52% pure based on NMR strength.  Conclusion: The desired product was isolated but in relatively low yield and low purity.
